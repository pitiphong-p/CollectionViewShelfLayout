# CollectionViewShelfLayout
A UICollectionViewLayout subclass displays its items as rows of items similar to the App Store Feature tab without a nested UITableView/UICollectionView hack. You can use a single data source for all of your contents. Each section displays its items in a row. `CollectionViewShelfLayout` supports collection view's *header view and footer view* similar to table view's *tableHeaderView and tableFooterView* also *sections' header and footer views* too.
